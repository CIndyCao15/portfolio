#### Research

An Application Research of Real-Time Non-Photorealistic Rendering Technology Based on Unity Engine in Virtual Production

* Developed a Chinese brush painting character rendering scheme based on the viewing direction and bump map for contour rendering, achieved soft willow-leaf-shaped stroke for charactersâ€™ pleats by using one-dimensional look-up table, realized grayscale adjustment for internal coloring, stimulated the effect of random splashing ink with a triplanar stroke map based on object space, and mixed contour line, internal coloring and splashing ink by texture blending
* Developed a Chinese brush painting mountain and rocks rendering scheme, rendered the outline of mountain stone with Shell Method-based dual-pass rendering methods and stimulated the effect of dry brushes and whitewashing, realized internal coloring with a shading method based on Half-Lambert lighting model and diffuse warping function and used triplanar to superimpose stroke texture, and stimulated the effect of ink diffusion with Gaussian blur
* Developed a demo showcase scene based on XR plug-in architecture from Unity 2019.3.0 with Oculus Rift S
