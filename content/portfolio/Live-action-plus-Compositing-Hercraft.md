To make the movie, we shot all the footage first, then we built each scene at a 1:1 scale in Cinema 4D and put Steve and the other characters in it. We did 3D animation and rendering in Cinema 4D, then composed in After Effects. Finally, the finished film was color graded in DaVinci Resolve.

### Props

The girl's diamond armor tile is shown below, including helmet, chestplate, shoulder armors, leggings, etc. In the actual shooting process, considering the convenience of the girl's movement, the leggings were discarded. The diamond armor is printed on kraft paper laminated foam board. After cropping and folding, it is fixed with a hot glue gun.

Color grading isn't just post-production. Throughout the entire shooting process, since we didn't have a technical monitor on site, after a day's shooting, it's necessary to conduct quality assurance on the day's takes, and pick out the number of shots that need to be reshot. I did this step in DaVinci Resolve. Combined with the continuity sheet, I can quickly sort out the OK / KEEP / NG (not good) takes. 

Unfortunately, the raw footage was lost, and there is no way to present this part. These are the behind-the-scenes photos when I was on the crew of *Doppelganger* (《AB面》) in 2019 as a DIT. The DIT software I used was Silverstack, and I did the sound-image synchronization and rough cuts on the set after each day of shooting.

### Post-Production

The post-production of this film mainly includes editing, 3D animation production, compositing and color grading. I was involved in the process of the last three. The 3D animation was created in Cinema 4D. I also used Cinema 4D for tracking and calculating the camera position. Keying and compositing was done in After Effect and color grading was done in Davinci Resolve.

#### 3D Animation

I created keyframe animations with rigged characters in Cinema 4D. In Cinema 4D, the scene structures were first built according to the size of the actual shooting set, to avoid making the virtual character too big or too small during compositing, and to make tracking easier.
