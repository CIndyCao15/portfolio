This movie is a Minecraft fanfic. To make the movie, we shot all the footage first, then we built each scene at a 1:1 scale in Cinema 4D and put Steve and the other characters in it. We did 3D animation and rendering in Cinema 4D, then composed in After Effects. Finally, the finished film was color graded in DaVinci Resolve.

### Props

The girl's diamond armor tile is shown below, including helmet, chestplate, shoulder armors, leggings, etc. In the actual shooting process, considering the convenience of the girl's movement, the leggings were discarded. The diamond armor is printed on kraft paper laminated foam board. After cropping and folding, it is fixed with a hot glue gun.
