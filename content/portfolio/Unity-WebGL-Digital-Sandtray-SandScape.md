        SandScape is an industrial collaboration with BC Children's Hospital Digital Lab, aimed at developing a digital therapeutic tool for kids. As part of an agile team of six students, we employed a user-centered design approach to create a digital sandtray using Unity, which was deployed to WebGL. This tool supports therapeutic practices, helping children through interactive and immersive experiences.
